Two hydrological mdoels, the HBV and HYMOD were analysed on a set of 10 catchments around Australia

The main.py can be used to calibrate the models.
The calibrated parameters for the catchments studied is in the paramters folder.
Normal model parameters are in the calibrated choosen folder
Ensemble calibrated parameters are in the 220924 folder


This code should be read in conjunciton with my final year project report.
